# Building your own Tulip Creative Computer

[If you don't want to buy your own Tulip CC](https://tulip.computer), there are four ways to start building and using your own [Tulip Creative Computer.](../README.md) 

 * [No hardware for me, I want to just run Tulip Desktop or Tulip Web on my desktop computer for now.](tulip_desktop.md) Use this option if you're just curious about Tulip and want to try it out. If you get into it, you can then upgrade to real hardware!
 * [I just want to build a temporary Tulip with hookup wires and a breadboard.](tulip_breadboard.md) Do this if you aren't great at soldering or just want to quickly throw a Tulip together. It won't be very stable and will be hard to move or use portably, as there's many wires. But it'll work!
 * [I can solder through-hole just fine and want to build a more reliable Tulip with your breakout board PCB.](tulip_breakout.md) Do this if you are competent at thru-hole soldering and want to make a reliable Tulip by soldering together other breakout boards. You can buy a cheap PCB that bridges together all the things you need. It's more bulky than our integrated Tulip board, but works just the same. 
 * [I want to build a single board Tulip and know how to solder SMT or use a service that assembles one for me.](tulip_board.md) This is the deluxe option: a fully integrated Tulip board with connectors for a display, audio, MIDI and keyboard. Like a Raspberry Pi but it's Tulip. But you'll need either good soldering skills (many small SMT parts and the FPC connector) or use a service like JLCPCB, PCBway, or Aisler to assemble the board for you. 

 When you're done building your Tulip Creative Computer, [next learn how to compile and flash the firmware.](tulip_flashing.md)
