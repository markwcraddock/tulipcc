# Troubleshooting your Tulip

Here's a page to check out when you're having problems with your Tulip. We'll list common issues and their resolutions, and then general diagnostic help.

This is for hardware Tulip CCs you got from [Makerfabs](https://tulip.computer). If your hardware Tulip is DIY or you're having issues in Tulip Desktop or Tulip Web, you can ask the community for help.

## Reach us

For help, the community of people that can help out with Tulip are

 * Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TzBFkUb8pG)
 * [Tulip GitHub issues](https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/issues)
 * [Tulip GitHub discussions](https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/discussions)
 * [Makerfabs contact](https://makerfabs.com/contact.html)

**Please remember**: Tulip is supported by volunteers. Makerfabs will send you a tested board free of hardware faults, and the community will do our best to support you using Tulip and fixing any issues with the firmware. If you're having issues, please follow this guide and [contact us](#reach-us) with any questions, but be patient! 

**If you believe the board you received has a hardware fault, contact Makerfabs directly, the community does not handle shipping / testing / fulfillment.** But please try to resolve and diganose the issue here first.  

## Always upgrade Tulip first

First, always [upgrade your Tulip to the latest firmware](tulip_flashing.md). If your Tulip is running, and the keyboard and Wi-Fi are working, try to first upgrade to a release by running `tulip.wifi(ssid, password)` and then `tulip.upgrade()`. Take a note of the date of the Tulip OS that shows on the screen after you reboot it. The date should match the [latest release of Tulip](https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/releases).  If it's older, try again, or try to flash manually.

## Tulip won't start properly, black screen

First be certain that your Tulip is switched on (the switch to the right, facing your Tulip) and being powered properly. Even if your Tulip is not showing the REPL screen, it should be showing an LCD backlight glow (there are no other LEDs on Tulip.) Make sure your USB connector or battery is seated properly. The USB adapter should support at least 1A of power. 

If you think your Tulip is powered properly but not booting, try to first reset the Tulip. Flip the power switch on and off a few times. Hit the RESET button a few times. Try unplugging your USB keyboard if you have one. Wait a few seconds. There are rare instances (usually temperature related) where the chip may not boot properly, but a reboot or two will usually fix it. 

If your Tulip makes a startup noise but doesn't show the screen, there may be an issue with your screen. The startup "bleep" should only happen if the system boots properly.

## Flash a Tulip manually

You may also want to flash manually if your Tulip is not booting at all, or we release a fix for your issue that hasn't hit a release yet. To do so, see the section called [flash Tulip from a compiled release](tulip_flashing.md). This requires a USB cable between a computer and the `USB program` port on your Tulip (the top one.) 

## See the diagnostic output of a Tulip

The `USB program / charge` port shows up as a serial port on your computer when connected. You can see the output of the Tulip as it boots (and also control your Tulip from the port) if you connect it to your computer and run a serial terminal program. On Mac and Linux you can use the built in `screen`: just find your serial port (do `ls /dev/*usb*` and find one that looks like `/dev/cu.wchusbserialXXXX`) and run `screen /dev/cu.wchusbserialXXX 115200`. On other platforms find any serial terminal and connect it to the Tulip USB port and run it at 115200 baud.

Then push the `BOOT` button on your Tulip and you'll see screen like:

```

Starting MIDI on core 0
UART MIDI running on core 0
Starting USB host on core 1
Starting display on core 0
Starting touchscreen on core 0

## Tulip's touchscreen doesn't work at all

If your touchscreen appears to not respond, the most likely explanation is the touchscreen panel cable got loose during shipping or if you installed a battery. We're working with Makerfabs to tape down this connector for higher reliability. But it's a quick fix if it happens to you. Just take off the back case, unseat the touch connector (labeled above) by pulling up the black clamp, and push back in the cable tight, applying a little pressure. Clamp it back, and take a piece of tape to hold down the cable right at the connector, like this:

## The touchscreen works but it's hard to tap on the menu, switch or quit buttons

Some newer Tulips are shipping with the touch panel in a slightly different orientation, which is causing our old calibration to not be accurate. First, try the Tulip World `paint.py` program to test your touchscreen: do `world.download('paint.py')` and then `run('paint')`. A few users have then said that their newer Tulip's touchscreen acts better with a `y_scale` of 0.75 instead of our default 0.8. To fix that, `run('calibrate')` and note its suggested `touch_delta`, and write it to your `boot.py` when it asks. Calibration does not currently guess the `y_scale`, so `edit('boot.py')` and change the `0.8` in `touch_delta()` (the last of 3 numbers) to `0.75`. Try `run('paint')` again! If you're still stuck, [we'd love your help debugging this more!](#reach-us)

## Your USB keyboard's keys are typing the wrong characters

Tulip uses low-level USB keyboard scan codes to translate from keypresses to ASCII to show on screen. We don't have the luxury of an OS to translate these for us across all the different locales of keyboards in the world! If your keyboard is not a US keyboard, you'll need to remap some keys. You can do it one at a time with `tulip.remap()`, which will interactively prompt you for key mappings. 

 - If you have a German keyboard, Tulip community friend `olav` has contributed a keymap on Tulip World: get it from `world.download('keys_de.txt')`. 
 - If you have a French keyboard, `remis` made `world.download('keys_fr.txt')`

You can see how to use them with Olav's `boot.py`: `world.download('boot.py', 'olav')`

## USB computer keyboard not working

If your USB computer keyboard is not working, please find us on [issues](https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/issues) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/TzBFkUb8pG) and we'll help out! We have tested many keyboards but since we have to build this support ourselves there are likely edge cases we haven't run into yet. 

## The Mabee DAC is not correctly sending CV / Gate values to your modular synthesizer

If you can't seem to control your modular synths with the DAC, please note that the current revision of the <a href="https://www.makerfabs.com/mabee-dac-gp8413.html">Mabee DAC</a>is set up for TRS (stereo 3.5mm) cables. To use with a mono modular patch cable, you will need a stereo to mono <a href="https://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-Adapter-Plated-Female/dp/B0919C5D93">adapter</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gold-Plated-Connector-Splitter-RFAdapter-Headphone/dp/B096XNHTH3/">cable</a> plugged in at the DAC end. You can also slightly pull out a mono cable's connector. We are working on fixing this for future batches and will update this when we do.
